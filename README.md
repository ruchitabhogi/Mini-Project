 Title: Enhancing E-commerce Recommendations using Sequential Deep Learning
 Abstract: E-commerce websites uses recommendation systems to boost sales by guiding users to relevant products
 based on their preferences and browsing history as it enhances the overall shopping experience and
 customer satisfaction. Collaborative-Based Sequential Recommendation systems predict a user’s next item
 based on their historical behavior sequence, combining long-term and short-term preferences. These
 systems enhance recommendation quality by considering collaborative relations and temporal context.
 Sequential-based algorithm is used here to capture both long and short-term user preferences using
 attention mechanism, a time-aware controller and a content-aware controller, which results in more
 effective personalized recommendations compared to non-sequential approaches. It uses a attentive
 Asymmetric-SVD paradigm to pay attention to both user’s long-term interests (like things user
 consistently enjoy) and short-term interests (like what user is into right now) as it dynamically fuses the
 long-term component and short-term component.This system adjusts how it remember things based on
 two factors: the irregularity of when user liked things and the meaning behind user’s preferences. It
 changes how it stores information to better understand both when and why user like certain items. It
 addresses the cold start problem (providing accurate recommendations when having limited data for new
 users or items) by focusing on the order of interactions of the user and preferences observed across the
 user base to provide relevant suggestions. It pays attention to both what user have liked for a long time
 and what user likes right now, to provide recommendations that fit user interests at any given moment.
